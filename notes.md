- Temporal is a platform that guarantees code execution of your application
- al;lows one to develop as though failures never existed
- app runs despite of failures like network
- here application is developed using workflows written as code
- these workflows can keep running even for years even in the failure of the infrastructure
- if app dies temporal will resume from where it stopped
- a workflow is a sequence of steps
- these steps are carried out as workflows termed as workflow execution

 ## workflow characteristics
- long running process
- conditional logic
- can contain cycles
